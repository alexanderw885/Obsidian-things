rushed creation, thought it was happening Tuesday. be more forgiving of you give feedback
very good setup explaining need
good looking to audience 
very thorough on explaining the why, but not as much about the how
didn't cover much tone
a bit long, could be more concise, 18 min
good elaboration on points on slides



# Avoiding "ad-speak" and persuading in professional environment
## Archie, Nahir

a bit  quiet, could speak up more
explained what ad-speak was clearly, and why not to use them
at bit short, 6 min before questions

# How to engage in effective "peer review"
## Kristina, Jonah

clearly describes motive and definition
gave author responsibilities, which I had never thought of
that looks like an improperly introduced list
parts 1 and 2 and 3 could be more concise, a bit shorter
very thorough explanation of reviewer's responsibilities
good, well-explained examples of phrases to use in review
altogether very good points and ideas, very thorough, but each point is overelaborated on
I do like the "Key Takeaways" slide
much too long, 23 minutes before questions

thorough and clear
good length
