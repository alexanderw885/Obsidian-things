## Mean

mean is average of set of observations.
$\bar{x}$ above it denotes sample mean
$\bar{\mu}$ represents population mean.
$\bar{\mu}$ is often unknowable, estimate with x-bar
$$(\frac{1}{n})\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i = \bar{x}$$



example:
sample mean of
{10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 6}
$\frac{10+6+12+7+3+6}{n}$ 
$44\over6$ 
**$22\over3$

on calculator:
put calculator into stats mode (mode 1)
enter number, then hit M+
repeat for each number
to get mean, press RCL+left bracket

## Median

Median is the "middle" observation of a **sorted** data set
represented as $\tilde{x}$
median is less effected by outliers

if n is odd, $\tilde{x}$ is middle item
ex:
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11}
 $\tilde{x}$/median $= 7$

if n is even, $\tilde{x}$ is average of middle two items
ex:
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}
 $\tilde{x}$/median $= (5+7)/2$
$=6$ 

## Mode

the mode is the most frequent observation, used in data sets with repetition.
There can be multiple modes, or no modes.

ex:
a) {3, 5, 9, 9, 5}
	mode = 9
b) {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5}
	mode = 3, 4
c) {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	no modes


## Practice
find the i) mean, ii) mode, and iii) median of

a) {3, 3, 4, 4, 6}
	i) $\bar{x} = \frac{3+3+4+4+6}{5} = 4$
	ii) $\tilde{x} = 4$
	iii) Mode $= 3, 4$ 

b) {3, 3, 4, 4, 26}
	i) $\bar{x} = \frac{3+3+4+4+26}{5} = 8.4$
	ii) $\tilde{x} = 4$
	iii) mode $= 3, 4$

c) {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42}
	i) $\bar{x} = \frac{4+8+15+16+23+42}{6} = 18$
	ii) $\tilde{x} = \frac{15+16}{2} = 15.5$
	iii) no mode


When to use median instead of mean?
	When you expect there are outliers in the data set

suppose one set with standard deviation $s_1=5$, and one set with stand. dev $s_2=10$ 
	we don't know what set is more "spread out"
