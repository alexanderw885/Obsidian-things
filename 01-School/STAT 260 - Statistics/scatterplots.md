Data with two variables are call __bivariate__, and gives as a set of ordered pairs: $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_n,y_n)$ 

Used to represent bivariate data.

to use a scatterplot, both measurements must be made on the same object.
One axis used for variable-1, the other axis for variable-2
$x\leftarrow(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$
$y\leftarrow(y_1,y_2,...,y_n)$


#### examples
We select 20 people, and for each person, we record x, their  
age, and y, their maximum heart rate. Would a scatterplot be appropriate?
	Yes, both measures are done on the same subject

We select 20 people and put them on Diet A, and measure x,  
their blood pressure after two weeks. We select another 20 people and put  
them on Diet B, and measure y, their blood pressure after two weeks. Would  
a scatterplot be appropriate?  
	No, each measurement is done on a separate group of people.
	this gives us two univariate data sets

lets look at that image at the top of the page again ![[Pasted image 20240117103903.png]]
this set is made of the ordered pairs $(19.5,3900),(20,4205),...,(22.5,5140)$
