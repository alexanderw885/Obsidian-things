Coefficient of variation $(cv)$ can be used to compare to other types of sets. it is dimensionless

$cv = s/\bar{x}$ 

### examples
set one: $\bar{x}=25, s=7$
set two: $\bar{x}=54, s=9$ 
we use $cv$ because we don't know what types of measurements were used in each set. Since $cv$ is dimensionless, types of measurement don't matter
$cv_1 = 1/5$
$cv_2 = 1/6$ 
therefore, set one has more variability 

Jem's set uses meters.
Kimber's set uses centimeters

Jem's data       $set_1 = 1.71, 1.73, 1.81, 1.82, 1.80$
Kimber's data  $set_2 = 171, 173, 181, 182, 180$
$cv_1 = 0.0284$
$cv_2 = 0.0284$
it makes sense the std. deviation of the two would be the same, since both sets use the same information measured in different units since we used the coefficient of variation, which ignores units.
