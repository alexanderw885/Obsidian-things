An experiment is any activity where we can measure/observe the results.

The sample space $S$ is the set of all possible out comes.
ex: the sample space of flipping a coin $S=\{heads, tails\}$ 

a sample point is a single outcome in the sample space.
an event is any subset of $S$
a simple event is an event with a single outcome
a compound event has multiple outcomes

ex: sample space of flipping a coin 3 times
$$S=\{HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\}$$
$HHH$ is a sample point, or a single event
$\{HHH, HHT\}$ is an example of an event

intersection of $A, B=A\cap{B}$$
union of $A,B=A\cup{B}$ 
compliment of $A=\bar{A}, A',$ or $A^C$
or is inclusive

### examples 

ex: select an integer from 1-10
	$S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$
	$E$=event odd number is selected
		$E= \{1,3,5,7, 9\}$
	$F$=event prime number is selected
		$F= \{2,3,5,7,\}$ 
		
	$E\cap{F}=\{3,5,7\}$
	$E\cup{F}=\{1,2,3,5,7,9\}$
	$\bar{E}=\{2,4,6,8,10\}$

ex: ball has red, blue, green marbles. pick two, sequence matters. what is $S$?
	$S=\{RR,RG,RB,GR,GG,GB,BR,BG,BB\}$
